# First_project

1. The objective of this project is to address all the usual tasks of a Data Scientist (Preprocessing, data analysis, A/B testing, supervised/unsupervised learning, regressions/classifications, Deep Learning, time series and so on). This project is related to my education and professional experience. It allows me to demonstrate my skills in common data science tasks (and also as a data analyst using Python).
2. As part of this project, I will create several notebooks with annotations to explain my code and help people understand my vision behind it. Each notebook will focus on a specific topic (the topic will be the title).
3. All my notebooks will first be written in Python. I will then publish versions of these notebooks in other languages commonly used by data scientists (R and PySpark). The Python libraries used in this notebook are those commonly used in machine learning, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PyTorch, HuggingFace, TensorFlow and so on.
4. How to run it (from git commands to local stations) :
